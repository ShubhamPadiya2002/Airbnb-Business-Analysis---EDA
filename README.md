Airbnb, Inc. is an American company operating an online marketplace for short- and long-term homestays and experiences. The company acts as a broker and charges a
commission from each booking. **The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia.** The idea originated when Chesky and Gebbia,
struggling to pay rent, rented out air mattresses in their San Francisco apartment, which evolved into **"Air Bed & Breakfast."** Airbnb has built a vast global community, operating in
over 220 countries with millions of listings. The company went public in December 2020, marking a significant milestone. Today, under CEO Brian Chesky's leadership, Airbnb
continues to innovate, adapting to changing travel trends and fostering cultural exchange through personalized travel experiences

Airbnb’s revenue model primarily revolves a **two-sided marketplace** around charging service fees to both hosts and guests for facilitating bookings through its platform. Airbnb
generates revenue through service fees charged to both hosts and guests for each booking made on its platform. For guests, the service fee typically ranges from **6% to 12%** of the
booking subtotal, while hosts are charged around **3%** of the subtotal. This fee structure allows Airbnb to earn a commission on every transaction. In addition to these fees, Airbnb
offers various value-added services to hosts, such as professional photography and property management services, which also contribute to its revenue.

## Limitation of the Project

• **Data Scope**        - The analysis might be limited to the data available in the IMDb database, which may not cover all movies or have complete information for each title.                          
• **Limitations Depth** - The project uses tools like Excel and pivot tables, which are powerful but may not offer the same depth of analysis as more advanced statistical software.                       
• **Timeframe**         - The project seems to cover data up to a certain point, which means recent movies or trends might not be included.                                                  
• **Data Accuracy**     - The accuracy of the data could be a limitation. Since the data is user-generated, there may be errors or inaccuracies that could affect the results of the analysis. Users may submit 
                       incorrect information or make subjective judgments about movie ratings, which could introduce biases into the analysis.

## Conclusion

• Through this analysis, We have build good theoretical knowledge about movies and their terms like what is the difference between genre & rating, etc.                                                         
• With the help of this analysis , We find insights related to some important movies terms like contribution of genre(%) ,gross revenue ,budget ,director, actors.                                                
• In this analysis, we also discover some time patterns like which month movies release the most. This analysis help director to decide release month.                                                         
• Through this analysis, We understand the power of pivot table that how pivot table solve complex questions easily.                                                                                
• Through cost analysis, We understand the very important concept of profit margin & cost. As a producer , we must should focus on cost or budget of a movie because profit margin is inversely proportional to Cost.                                                                                                                                      
• With the help of analysis of time duration, the director decide how many mins of movie should he make for get best IMDb range.
